# Quote of the month
> The citizen who thinks he sees that the commonwealth's political clothes are worn out, and yet hold his peace and does not agitate for a new suit, is disloyal; he is a traitor. That he may be the only one who thinks he sees this decay, does not excuse him; it is his duty to agitate any way, and it is the duty of the others to vote him down if they do not see the matter as he does. *-Mark Twain*

### Welcome! <span style="color:grey"> <font size="2"> 15/06/23 </font> </span>

Welcome to my site! There's not much for me to say here on account of this being such a new project. My vision is to post poetry I've written, some journal entries of mine, and perhaps a book review or two. I'll also have an email set up so to receive any suggestions or comments for the site, or for my writing. I'm certainly eager for any feedback!

That's it for now,
The Undergraduate Philosopher
