### Welcome! <span style="color:grey"> <font size="2"> 15/06/23 </font> </span>

Welcome to my site! There's not much for me to say here on account of this being such a new project. My vision is to post poetry I've written, some journal entries of mine, and perhaps a book review or two. I'll also have an email set up so to receive any suggestions or comments for the site, or for my writing. I'm certainly eager for any feedback!

That's it for now, <br>
The Undergraduate Philosopher
